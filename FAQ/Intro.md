## 🚌 Event Bus Architecture

### Overview

The **Cortan Event Bus** is the central nervous system of the Cortan Orchestrator, providing a sophisticated event-driven architecture that enables seamless communication between all system components. Built with modern C++20 patterns, it supports asynchronous processing, context-awareness, and intelligent routing.

### Core Components

#### 1. Event Types & Hierarchy

The event system supports multiple specialized event types:

```
BaseEvent (Abstract)
├── UserRequestEvent     # User commands, questions, statements
├── AIProcessingEvent    # Model processing, task lifecycle
├── EnvironmentalEvent   # System status, sensor data
├── LearningEvent        # Behavior patterns, preferences
└── WelcomeEvent         # User onboarding, personalization
```

#### 2. Priority System

Events are processed based on urgency levels:

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Mission-critical, immediate response required
- **🟠 HIGH**: Important requests, security alerts
- **🟡 NORMAL**: Standard interactions, routine tasks
- **🟢 LOW**: Background tasks, suggestions, learning
- **🔵 BACKGROUND**: Maintenance, cleanup, passive monitoring

#### 3. Handler Types

The event bus supports multiple handler registration patterns:

```cpp
// Type-specific handlers
bus.subscribe("user.request", handler);

// Context-filtered handlers with user awareness
bus.subscribeWithContext("user.request", filtered_handler);

// Priority-based handlers
bus.subscribePriority(EventPriority::HIGH, handler);

// Emergency handlers (automatic for CRITICAL events)
bus.subscribeUrgent(handler);
```

### Advanced Features

#### Context-Aware Processing

Every event carries rich contextual information:

```cpp
struct EventContext {
    std::shared_ptr<UserProfile> user_profile;
    std::string location_context;           // "mission_control", "field_ops"
    std::string emotional_state;            // "focused", "concerned", "playful"
    float urgency_level;                    // 0.0 = casual, 1.0 = emergency
    std::unordered_map<std::string, std::string> metadata;
};
```

#### Dynamic User Profiling

The system maintains sophisticated user profiles:

```cpp
struct UserProfile {
    float familiarity_level;                // 0.0 = new, 1.0 = best friend
    std::string relationship_status;        // "acquaintance" → "friend" → "confidant"
    UserPreferences preferences;            // greeting style, response format
    std::vector<std::string> interests;     // topics of interest
    std::unordered_map<std::string, int> interaction_patterns;
};
```

#### Proactive Suggestions

The event bus can generate intelligent suggestions:

```cpp
bus.publishProactive(
    "Consider running tests before pushing to main",
    user_context,
    EventPriority::LOW
);
```

#### Emergency Override System

Critical situations trigger immediate system-wide responses:

```cpp
bus.publishEmergency(
    "Critical threat detected! Activating protocols.",
    "evacuation_mission_alpha"
);
```

### Event Flow Architecture

└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Threading Model

#### Asynchronous Processing

- **Non-blocking**: All handlers return `std::future<void>`
- **Thread Pool**: Efficient concurrent execution
- **Error Resilience**: Handler exceptions don't crash the system
- **Timeout Protection**: Emergency events have 5-second timeouts

#### Example: Concurrent Handler Execution

```cpp
// Multiple handlers execute simultaneously
std::vector<std::future<void>> futures;
for (auto& handler : relevant_handlers) {
    futures.push_back(handler(*event));
}

// Wait for all to complete
for (auto& future : futures) {
    future.get();  // Blocking wait with error handling
}
```

### Factory Pattern Implementation

The system provides convenient factory functions for common events:

```cpp
// User interactions
auto command = createUserCommand("analyze data", "rishab");
auto question = createUserQuestion("What's the status?", "rishab");
auto casual = createCasualConversation("How's it going?", "rishab");

// AI processing
auto task_start = createTaskStarted("task_1", "Processing data");
auto progress = createTaskProgress("task_1", "67% complete");
auto complete = createTaskCompleted("task_1", "Analysis finished");

// Learning & environment
auto preference = createUserPreference("prefers detailed output", 0.85f);
auto pattern = createBehaviorPattern("morning productivity peak", 0.92f);
```

### Performance Characteristics

#### Memory Management
- **Smart Pointers**: `std::shared_ptr` for event ownership
- **RAII**: Automatic resource cleanup
- **Memory Pools**: Custom allocators for high-frequency events

#### Scalability Features
- **Handler Registration**: O(1) average case complexity
- **Event Routing**: Efficient hash-based lookups
- **Context Filtering**: Lazy evaluation for performance

### Integration Examples

#### Basic Event Publishing

```cpp
// Create and publish a user request
auto event = createUserCommand("process data", "user_id");
bus.publish("user.request", event).get();  // Synchronous wait
```

#### Advanced Context-Aware Handling

```cpp
// Handler with context filtering
bus.subscribeWithContext("user.request",
    [](const BaseEvent& event, const EventContext& context) -> std::future<void> {
        return std::async(std::launch::async, [&]() {
            if (context.getFamiliarityLevel() > 0.7f) {
                // Personalized response for familiar users
                std::cout << "Hey friend! Processing your request...\n";
            } else {
                // Formal response for new users
                std::cout << "Processing request. Please wait...\n";
            }
        });
    });
```
