# 🤖 Cortan Orchestrator - Project Introduction

## What is Cortan Orchestrator?

**Cortan Orchestrator** is a cutting-edge AI-powered multi-model orchestration engine designed to seamlessly coordinate multiple AI models and services. This is a prototype implementation showcasing advanced AI orchestration patterns and modern C++ development practices.

## 🏗️ Core Concept

Inspired by Microsoft's Cortana AI assistant, this project reimagines AI orchestration for developers and technical environments. Unlike consumer-focused virtual assistants, Cortan Orchestrator focuses on:

- **Multi-Model Coordination**: Managing and coordinating multiple AI models simultaneously
- **Workflow Automation**: Streamlining complex AI-driven processes
- **Real-time Processing**: High-performance, async processing with C++ coroutines
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with pluggable components

## 🚀 Key Features
